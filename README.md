Tips to working with git and github

## Austin Collins
I am a Comp-Sci major possibly interested in minoring in Data Science.  
In the past month i've been working with Java , trying to learn R and Rstudio, and reviewing Inheritance and Polymorphism.  
To organize my files I connect my PC in my apartment to the ISU VPN to acess files from home.
